# Bounty Hunters

A website for hosting games of Bounty Hunters. The basic rules are as follows:

* Everyone starts with a score of 1 point.
* Everyone has a bounty on them - it is equal to 25% of her total score 
  (round up for fractions).
* If someone is killed, the killer gets the bounty (it is added to her score)
  and the victim has the bounty subtracted from her score.
* After a set amount of time, the hunter with the highest score is declared 
  the winner

The magic of this game is in the fact that it "self-balances": 

* players who are really intense about it and collect a lot of points very 
  quickly will find it hard to get points, and the majority of other players
  will go after them.
* players who can't put a lot of time into the game or drop out will quickly
  reach 0 points and no one will have an incentive to kill them; however, a
  player can rejoin the game at any point by killing someone with points.
