# Bounty Hunters

A website for hosting games of Bounty Hunters. The basic rules are as follows:

* Everyone starts with a score of 1 point.
* Everyone has a bounty on them - it is equal to 25% of her total score 
  (round up for fractions).
* If someone is killed, the killer gets the bounty (it is added to her score)
  and the victim has the bounty subtracted from her score.
* After a set amount of time, the hunter with the highest score is declared 
  the winner
